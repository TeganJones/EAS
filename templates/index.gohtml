           The ​C​omeback ​C​ommunity™ and the ​B​rain Food Project™ present a professional development opportunity for higher

           education student services faculty, staff, and student staff as well as administrators.  This program and

           attached training focus on Empathy, Awareness, and Sensitivity (EAS) or what is commonly referred to as EAS

           (said ease), an implementation that supports students holistically in an effort to increase student equity.

           The training can be presented with or without a certification and is paired with the Brain Food Project to

           ensure proper implementation and sustainability for student equity at your college.

        </p>
        <p>

          Hello! Thank you so much for your interest in the Brain Food Project™. I began the Brain Food Project™ in

          the spring of 2015 as a response to two major problems I noticed in practice. The two problems included

          the following: a) low attendance for SI and tutoring sessions and b) food insecurity among college

          students. The Brain Food Project™ is modeled from Skinner's operant conditioning, implementing

          positive reinforcement. The idea behind the Brain Food Project™ is simple-- - provide nutritious and

          popular food items to students when they attend SI and tutoring sessions. Brain Food is presented to

          students in stations on tables, and students may access the food freely and without proving need (mini

          refrigerators store perishable items). Brain Food provides community as well as sustenance for students

          while they work individually or collaboratively. The Brain Food Project™ provides options ranging from

          full meals to snacks. The funding for Brain Food comes from multiple sources including grants,

          community donations, and corporate contributions. Serving students to meet needs and create equity

          to bridge academic and social gaps is at the heart of the program. We set out to normalize receiving

          help by meeting students' basic needs, and we did just that. According to the CCCSE (2012), the average

          attendance rate for supplemental instruction is 18% among community colleges while tutoring has an

          average attendance rate of 24%. Neither of these percentages are promising. In addition to this, food

          insecurity, what I often call the dirty little secret of higher education, has been running rampant in our

          institutions for years. In fact, daily news illuminates the unmet needs of students and the impact on

          their day-to- day lives and academic success. While students are often provided food at school during K-

          12, support with basic needs such as food is not common place in higher education. Albeit uncommon, I

          found that providing food during supplemental instruction and tutoring sessions increased our

          attendance rates from 26% to 85% in one year. What we also found was our students expressed feeling

          cared for authentically. Please take a moment to view the presentation below indicating the details of the

          Brain Food Project™ and the forthcoming handbook and certification process. It is my goal to have the

          Brain Food Project™ on campuses across the country so that we can holistically support student success.

          The Brain Food Project™ handbook, checklist, resources page, and certification process will be available

          very soon. I am also seeking five colleges/universities to pilot the Brain Food Project™. Please contact us

          if you are interested in being considered.

             <h2 class="uppercase pad-bottom-20">Changing the Face of Education with the ‘Pedagogy of Encouragement' and the ‘Brain Food Project’</h2>
              <p>
               The Comeback Community is a community and school of thought that includes a pedagogical drive called the “Pedagogy of Encouragement” and encouraging implementations, such as the “Brain Food Project” and other wide-ranging interpersonal strategies including E.A.S. (Empathy, Awareness, and Sensitivity). Created by Jennifer, The Comeback Community is a school of thought designed to change the face of higher education at all levels while uplifting myriad communities.  The overarching goal of The Comeback Community is to empower through encouragement. Specifically, The Comeback Community aims to demystify higher education and empower students for success in academics and life. The Comeback Community is shared by its founders through higher education presentations, original literature, website, and the forthcoming mobile application.
               The Comeback Community is fueled by the “Pedagogy of Encouragement,” which inspires educators to celebrate diverse experiences and implement holistic practices based in encouragement to support students and all persons in their endeavors. The most recent implementation of the “Pedagogy of Encouragement” is the “Brain Food Project,” which provides food (called “Brain Food”) to college students during SI/tutoring sessions to reduce food insecurity and foster productive learning assistance sessions. Providing Brain Food seeks to nurture community and reduce tutoring stigma by positively reinforcing student engagement and attendance for tutoring through the presence of healthy and palatable food items; when students break bread together, they study more and learn better. By encouraging students through meeting the basic need of food, food insecurity is reduced so students can focus their efforts on thriving rather than surviving.
               In order to demystify higher education, The Comeback Community believes that implementing pedagogical practices based in encouragement has the potential to support students as whole individuals who bring unique and diverse experiences to the greater community.

                What does it take to become a successful student? There are certainly some non-negotiable points to success in higher education; staying-power and desire to learn are necessary, but even more importantly is belief in oneself. While others may believe in your ability more than you do, initially, you can never fully succeed unless you make a choice to believe in yourself… are you willing to believe in yourself today? Are you willing to forget the failures and focus on today? Take a chance and remember there will be disappointment along the way, but keep believing because believing in yourself is the foundation for success. You are valuable; you are worth it. Our minds have a funny way of telling us we are not good enough or that we don’t really have what it takes, but these thoughts are untrue and come from a place of fear. I like to remember that every obstacle I encounter has been faced by someone else who was able to overcome it, which means it is possible for me (and you) to overcome it, too! This is the very first release of The Comeback Community’s “Comeback of the Day,” which is our regularly posted encouragement to you! In order to make your own comeback, please join the rest of our community by visiting our site regularly and deciding to believe in yourself today. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Say to yourself three times aloud and then again throughout the day, “I believe in myself, I believe in myself, I believe in myself.” And, remember, The Comeback Community believes in you! Keep your chin up today, and we’ll see you here again soon! Stay tuned for the forthcoming mobile app to receive the Comeback of the Day on your phone!

                Thank you for visiting The Comeback Community! Whether you are a student, educator, administrator, or community member, we are glad you are here! You are not reading this by mistake; you are reading this because it’s time for your Comeback! Welcome to The Comeback Community!©
