        <p>
           The ​C​omeback ​C​ommunity&trade; presents a training methodology for higher education student services faculty,

           staff, and student staff as well as administrators.  This training focuses on Empathy, Awareness, and

           Sensitivity (EAS) or what is commonly referred to as EAS (said ease), an implementation that supports students

            holistically in an effort to increase student equity. The training can be presented with or without a

            certification and is paired with <a href="http://brainfoodproject.org/">the Brain Food Project</a> to ensure proper implementation and sustainability

            for student equity at your college.

              Here's how we can help you use EAS to create equity on your campus:
            </p>
            <p>
              1) Invite us to speak at your college/university or event (e.g., keynote, full-day workshop, half-day workshop, three day training event); these are offered face-to-face or virtually and can include certification.
            </p>
            <p>
              2) Schedule a  face-to-face or virtual training for faculty, coordinators, leaders, tutors, administration, staff, community, and more (any of these groups can be served together or separately based on your need).
            </p>
            <p>
              4) Order EASe training materials (Pamphlet/handbook/etc.)
            </p>
            <p>
              *Please indicate your interest using the above when you email us; we look forward to helping you create a successful Brain Food Project on your campus.

             <h2 class="uppercase pad-bottom-20">Changing the Face of Education with the ‘Pedagogy of Encouragement, 'EASe', and the ‘Brain Food Project’</h2>
              <p>
               The Comeback Community is a community and school of thought that includes a pedagogical drive called the “Pedagogy of Encouragement” and encouraging implementations, such as the “Brain Food Project” and other wide-ranging interpersonal strategies including E.A.S. (Empathy, Awareness, and Sensitivity). Created by Jennifer, The Comeback Community is a school of thought designed to change the face of higher education at all levels while uplifting myriad communities.  The overarching goal of The Comeback Community is to empower through encouragement. Specifically, The Comeback Community aims to demystify higher education and empower students for success in academics and life. The Comeback Community is shared by its founders through higher education presentations, original literature, website, and the forthcoming mobile application.
               The Comeback Community is fueled by the “Pedagogy of Encouragement,” which inspires educators to celebrate diverse experiences and implement holistic practices based in encouragement to support students and all persons in their endeavors. The most recent implementation of the “Pedagogy of Encouragement” is the “Brain Food Project,” which provides food (called “Brain Food”) to college students during SI/tutoring sessions to reduce food insecurity and foster productive learning assistance sessions. Providing Brain Food seeks to nurture community and reduce tutoring stigma by positively reinforcing student engagement and attendance for tutoring through the presence of healthy and palatable food items; when students break bread together, they study more and learn better. By encouraging students through meeting the basic need of food, food insecurity is reduced so students can focus their efforts on thriving rather than surviving.
               In order to demystify higher education, The Comeback Community believes that implementing pedagogical practices based in encouragement has the potential to support students as whole individuals who bring unique and diverse experiences to the greater community.

                What does it take to become a successful student? There are certainly some non-negotiable points to success in higher education; staying-power and desire to learn are necessary, but even more importantly is belief in oneself. While others may believe in your ability more than you do, initially, you can never fully succeed unless you make a choice to believe in yourself… are you willing to believe in yourself today? Are you willing to forget the failures and focus on today? Take a chance and remember there will be disappointment along the way, but keep believing because believing in yourself is the foundation for success. You are valuable; you are worth it. Our minds have a funny way of telling us we are not good enough or that we don’t really have what it takes, but these thoughts are untrue and come from a place of fear. I like to remember that every obstacle I encounter has been faced by someone else who was able to overcome it, which means it is possible for me (and you) to overcome it, too! This is the very first release of The Comeback Community’s “Comeback of the Day,” which is our regularly posted encouragement to you! In order to make your own comeback, please join the rest of our community by visiting our site regularly and deciding to believe in yourself today. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Say to yourself three times aloud and then again throughout the day, “I believe in myself, I believe in myself, I believe in myself.” And, remember, The Comeback Community believes in you! Keep your chin up today, and we’ll see you here again soon! Stay tuned for the forthcoming mobile app to receive the Comeback of the Day on your phone!

                Thank you for visiting The Comeback Community! Whether you are a student, educator, administrator, or community member, we are glad you are here! You are not reading this by mistake; you are reading this because it’s time for your Comeback! Welcome to The Comeback Community!©
